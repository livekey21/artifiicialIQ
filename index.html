            While AI has been in the education technology space for a while,
            adoption has been slow. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic,
            virtual learning forced the industry to shift. AI helps streamline
            the student education process by offering access to suitable
            courses, bettering communication with tutors, and giving them more
            time to focus on other life aspects.
          </p>

          <p id="anotherOne">
            AI enhances the personalization of student learning programs and
            courses, promotes tutoring by helping students improve their weak
            spots and sharpen their skills, ensures quick responses between
            teachers and students, and enhances universal 24/7 learning access.

        Problem

          <p id="title">Affordable Higher Education</p>
          <p id="Text">
            Affordable higher education would provide our society with a better
            educated workforce, which in turn could help our economy grow. The
            United States of America is by far the richest country in the world;
            we could easily fund higher education, as we do for grades 1-12, if
            so we wanted to. There are plenty of ways we could re-appropriate
            funds towards our higher education system. Our governing body just
            does not have affordable higher education as a current priority.
            Luckily, proponents of free/affordable higher education programs
            such as Ocasio-Cortez, Warren, Sanders, and more,
            are gaining ground.

            <p id="title">1. Creating courses</p>
            <p id="Text">
              AI software for creating courses can help create interactive
              content seamlessly. You can efficiently work with your entire team
              via in-app comments from reviewers and co-authors to create
              perfect training material.
              <br />
              AI simplifies and accelerates course development. By assessing
              student learning history and abilities, AI gives teachers a clear
              picture of the lessons and subjects requiring reevaluation.
              Teachers alter their courses by evaluating every student’s
              specific needs to address common knowledge gaps. This enables
              teachers to develop the best learning programs for all students.

            <p id="Text">
              AI gives students a customized learning approach depending on
              their unique preferences and experiences. AI can adjust to every
              student’s knowledge level, desired goals, and learning speed to
              help get the most out of their learning. Additionally, AI-powered
              solutions can assess a student’s learning history, pinpoint
              weaknesses, and provide courses suitable for improvement, offering
              many opportunities for personalized learning experiences.

            <p id="Text">
              Teachers may not always know the gaps in their educational
              materials and lectures, which can confuse learners regarding
              particular concepts. AI provides a way to solve this issue. For
              instance, Coursera is already applying this. When many students
              give the wrong answers to their homework assignments, the system
              alerts the professor and offers future students customized
              messages that provide hints to the correct answer.
              <br />
              This kind of system fills the gaps in explanation in courses and
              ensures every student is building a similar conceptual foundation.
              Instead of waiting to hear from the teacher, students receive
              immediate feedback to help them understand concepts better.

              Smart content may include digital guides, textbooks, videos,
              instructional snippets, and AI, which develop customized
              environments for learning organizations depending on goals and
              strategies. Personalization in the education sector is a future
              world trend that can be achieved by pinpointing the areas where AI
              solutions can play a role. For instance, an educational
              institution can establish an AR/VR-based learning environment and
              web-based lessons to go with it.

            However, there are some negative aspects to Artificial Intelligence in education as well. A robot might not be as good a teacher as a human can be. The disadvantage of AI in education is that technology may not always be successful in teaching. AI does not experience emotions. Students don’t feel that they are being cared for by the AI when they are being lectured to or when they have a question, and when they do not get a response from the AI.
